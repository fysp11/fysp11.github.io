## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

If you find a bug, please ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/fysp11/fysp11.github.io/issues). If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/fysp11/fysp11.github.io/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample or an executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Suggesting Enhancements

If you have an idea for a new feature or an enhancement to an existing one, please [open an issue](https://github.com/fysp11/fysp11.github.io/issues/new) to discuss it. This allows us to coordinate our efforts and prevent duplication of work.

### Pull Requests

1.  **Fork the repository** and create your branch from `main`.
2.  **Set up your development environment** as described in the [README.md](README.md).
3.  **Make your changes**. Ensure your code adheres to the existing style.

## Style Guides

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").

- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line.

### Code Style

This project uses [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for code formatting and [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for linting. Please run `pnpm run format` and `pnpm run lint` before committing your changes to ensure they meet the project's coding standards.
