This project is a demonstration of my skills in 3D web graphics and creating [interactive user experiences](/projects/xr). I used `Three.js` for the core rendering and `React Three Fiber` to build the scene declaratively within an Astro project.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Interaction**: Users can interact with the 3D model.
- **Performant Rendering**: Optimized for smooth performance in the browser.
- **Component-Based**: Built with a modular and reusable component structure.
