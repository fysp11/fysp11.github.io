This project demonstrates the power of modern multi-modal AI. While this project focuses on generating content, I've also worked on [visualizing complex data](/projects/data) in real-time. Using Cloudflare Workers AI, this page runs open-source AI models serverlessly to generate both a creative story and a unique image from a single user prompt.

## Core Technologies

- **Framework**: Astro for the overall site structure and API routes.
- **Frontend**: A client-side interactive component built with React and TypeScript.
- **AI Integration**: Cloudflare Workers AI provides serverless GPU-powered inference with no API keys required.
- **AI Models**:
    - **Story Generation**: Meta Llama 3.1 8B for fast, creative text generation.
    - **Image Generation**: Flux 1 Schnell for high-quality image synthesis.
