This project leverages blockchain to bring transparency to the forestry supply chain. By creating an immutable record of custody, we can combat illegal logging and promote sustainability.

## Core Features

- **Smart Contracts**: Written in Solidity to manage the chain of custody and transfer of ownership.
- **Decentralized Ledger**: All transactions are recorded on the Ethereum blockchain for maximum security and transparency.
- **Web Interface**: A React-based dApp allows stakeholders to interact with the blockchain easily.
