This project demonstrates my expertise in data visualization and building real-time data pipelines. The dashboard connects to a live data stream and updates the charts and graphs dynamically.

### Technical Highlights:

- **Real-Time Updates**: Uses WebSockets to push data from the server to the client without delay.
- **Interactive Charts**: Built with D3.js to allow users to zoom, pan, and filter the data.
- **Data Processing**: The Python backend uses Pandas for efficient data manipulation and analysis.
