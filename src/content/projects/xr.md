This project explores the potential of XR to revolutionize eLearning. By creating immersive and interactive simulations, we can provide a safe and effective way for students to learn practical skills.

### Key Aspects:

- **Virtual Labs**: Students can conduct experiments and practice procedures in a realistic virtual laboratory.
- **Cross-Platform**: Built with Unity and WebXR to be accessible on a wide range of VR/AR devices.
- **Interactive Scenarios**: The application includes guided tutorials and open-ended challenges to test the user's knowledge.
