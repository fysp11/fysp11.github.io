This project showcases my ability to build end-to-end AI applications. The chatbot uses a custom-trained NLP model to understand and respond to user queries in real-time.

### Core Technologies:

- **Backend**: A Node.js server that hosts the TensorFlow model and provides a REST API.
- **Frontend**: A responsive React application for the chat interface.
- **AI Model**: A neural network built with TensorFlow and Keras for intent classification and entity recognition.
